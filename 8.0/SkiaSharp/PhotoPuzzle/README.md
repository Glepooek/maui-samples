# Photo Puzzle

This sample demonstrates the use of SkiaSharp in a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app. It's a variation of the classic 15 puzzle. On the early Mac, the 15 puzzle was called PUZZLE. In early Windows, it was the only sample for Microsoft Pascal for Windows 1.0, where it was called MUZZLE (for "Microsoft Puzzle"). This is the .NET MAUI version.

After pressing the **Randomize** button, just tap a tile to move it into an empty position. You can *tap* any tile in the row or column of the empty position to move one, two, or three tiles at once. Use the numbers in the lower-right corner of each tile as a guide.
